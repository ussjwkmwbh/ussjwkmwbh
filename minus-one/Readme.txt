Hi, I tried object oriented programming in python.
by just using simple ideas like this project.
Rock Paper Scissor Minus One from Squid games S2.
This game has mixed two other games. ie. Russian Roulette and Rock Paper Scissors

so in that same manner i separately scripted those 2 games and then I imported them in another file to make this game.

It was a nice project.
